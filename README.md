# Final Project

## Environment & Tools
operating system: Windows IDE: Clion Compiler: g++
 Cmake version: cmake-3.16.1-win32-x86 Git version: 2.24.1
## Purpose
The project aims to accomplish the usage of data structures,
operator overloading, classes and objects and encapsulation.

## Procedures
I think the solution can be reproduced by reducing redundancy
a problem i had was that i wrote to file and it was not correct
format but the problem was in overloading >> operator to read from
file, after implementing the clear of songs method, it worked.
another problem was simulating play and deleting(dequeu) the temp queue
but i had implemented operator overloading to assign the object
data to another, after changing and implementing copy constructor
the problem was fixed.
## Discussion
the purpose has been fulfilled and i learned alot from the project.
the specially difficult part for me was overloading >> operator
after some time i realized the problem.
the project can be solved in better ways wich i cannot think of at
the moment, the labs prepared me sufficiently.# music_program
